The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

    "In simple random sampling (SRS), every member or set of members has an equal chance to be selected in the final sample. We often use this method when we don’t have any kind of prior information about the target population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we actually do have a good amount of information about the population - address, coordinates, phone number, and postal code, etc. Let's try to use one of these information in our new sampling, by grouping the members via a specific factor/piece of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Members of the population are first partitioned into groups, called **strata**, by their postal codes. Then, within each group (**stratum**), members are randomly selected into the final probability sample, which is often a simple random sample (SRS). This method is called **stratified sampling**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE:**\n",
    "In Spring 2019, there were 800 students enrolled in Data 100, each of whom signed up for 1 of the 35 sections. Now we would like to survey 120 students to hear their thoughts on the midterm exam. One of the TAs proposed to do a stratified sampling; he grouped students by their standings - freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate (5 **strata** in total) - and randomly chose 24 students in each group (**stratum**), and survey these 120 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try to collect a stratified random sample of business names, where each stratum consists of a postal code. Collect one business name per stratum. Assign `bus_strat_sample` to a series of business names selected by this sampling procedure. Your output should be a series with the individual business names (not lists of one element each) as the values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Different from stratified sampling, in some cases we may not need a member from each group (stratum). Another way to utilize the information we have about the population is cluster sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster sampling, the population is also first divided into groups, called **clusters**, based on prior known information. Note that in cluster sampling, every member of the population is assigned to one, and only one, cluster. A sample of clusters is then chosen, using a probability method (often simple random sampling). All members of the selected clusters will be in the final probability sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE:**\n",
    "In Spring 2019, there were 800 students enrolled in Data 100, each of whom signed up for 1 of the 35 sections. Another TA proposed to do a cluster sampling; there were 35 sections that each has 25 seats. She randomly selected 5 sections (clusters); she didn't know how many students were there in each of these 5 sections (clusters). She ended up surveying 119 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try collect a cluster sample of business IDs, where each cluster is a postal code, with 5 clusters in the sample. Assign `bus_cluster_sample` to a series of business IDs selected by this sampling procedure. Reminder: Use the `postal_code_5` column.\n",

    "As we can see in this bar plot, the mode of all scores is 100. It is asymmetry and has a tail towards left. Some scores are not observed between 90 and 100. Scores around 65 is anamolous. One unusual feature is that most inspection scores are between 90 and 100 while the scores are concentrated on around 5 scores. Unlikely, there are relatively less scores range from 75 to 90 while roughly all integer scores are given. This observation implies that most of restaurants are good and got high score, some restaurants didn't reach the standards due to several reasons. Different standards have different measurements, if a restaurant didn't reach a number of standards, the score is low and more likely to be different to each other. For the restaurants that hardly loss scores, they may be more likely to get similar scores with only one or two weakness. "

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
