The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

    "\n",
    "We could write a few lines of code that are built to download this specific data file, but it's a better idea to have a general function that we can reuse for all of our assignments. Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

    "This function has the following arguments:\n",
    "- data_url: the web address to download\n",
    "- file: the file in which to save the results\n",
    "- data_dir: (default=\"data\") the location to save the data\n",
    "- force: if true the file is always re-downloaded \n",
    "\n",
    "The way this function works is that it checks to see if `data_dir/file` already exists. If it does not exist already or if `force=True`, the file at `data_url` is downloaded and placed at `data_dir/file`. The process of storing a data file for reuse later is called caching. If `data_dir/file` already and exists `force=False`, nothing is downloaded, and instead a message is printed letting you know the date of the cached file.\n",

She randomly selected 5 sections (clusters); she didn't know how many students were there in each of these 5 sections (clusters). She ended up surveying 119 students. \n",

    "As we can see in this bar plot, the mode of all scores is 100. It is asymmetry and has a tail towards left. Some scores are not observed between 90 and 100. Scores around 65 is anamolous. One unusual feature is that most inspection scores are between 90 and 100 while the scores are concentrated on around 5 scores. Unlikely, there are relatively less scores range from 75 to 90 while roughly all integer scores are given. This observation implies that most of restaurants are good and got high score, some restaurants didn't reach the standards due to several reasons. Different standards have different measurements, if a restaurant didn't reach a number of standards, the score is low and more likely to be different to each other. For the restaurants that hardly loss scores, they may be more likely to get similar scores with only one or two weakness. "

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
